# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning.

**Overview**

This project focuses on predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. It utilizes a dataset containing various passenger information to train models that predict whether a passenger survived or not during the Titanic disaster.

**Dependencies**

Python 3.x

Libraries:

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Seaborn (for visualization)

**Setup**

Clone the Repository

Install Dependencies: Use pip install -r requirements.txt to install required libraries.

Run the Code: Follow instructions in individual scripts/notebooks to preprocess data, train models, and make predictions.

**Usage**

Data Preprocessing: Review and clean the dataset using preprocessing scripts or notebooks.

Model Training: Run scripts/notebooks to train machine learning models on the preprocessed data.

Prediction: Use trained models to make predictions on new or test data.

**Acknowledgments**

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle.
